# Waboot Custom Filters for WooCommerce

This plugin allows shop owners to implement filterable products lists. Compared to WooCommerce defaults filters, the plugin builds a custom table to enhance performaces.

Products can be filtered by any meta fields or taxonomy.

The plugin can be set to apply the filters without reloading the page.
