# Waboot Custom Filters for WooCommerce

This plugin allows shop owners to implement filterable products lists. Compared to WooCommerce defaults filters, the plugin builds a custom table to enhance performaces.

Products can be filtered by any meta fields or taxonomy.

The plugin can be set to apply the filters without reloading the page.

Download the last compiled version [here](http://update.waboot.org/?action=get_metadata&slug=waboot-woo-product-filters&type=plugin) (coming soon). 

## Usage

Once activated, you need to create the product index. You can do this by going to "Filters settings" section under "WooCommerce" menu in dashboard.

Here you can select which data should be indexed for each product. After you done it, click the "Create table" button.
